Collection of save game exploits for FIFA games to run unsigned code on the DS.

CRCFix fixes the checksum of a save file to stop it showing up as corrupt in the game.

Exploit directory builds the exploitable save games.

Activating the exploit
###
For FIFA 10 activate the exploit by going to "My FIFA 10", "Creation Zone", and then "My Custom Club",
For FIFA Street 2 activate the exploit by going to "My Street", "Profile", and then "Edit Profile",
For all other supported games activate the exploit by going to "My FIFA (year)", and then "My Profile".

Currently CRC fixing code has been implemented for the following games:

- FIFA 06,
- FIFA 07,
- FIFA 08,
- FIFA 09,
- FIFA 10,
- FIFA Street 2,

And there is support for running code on the following games:

- FIFA 07,
- FIFA 08,
- FIFA 09,
- FIFA 10,
- FIFA Street 2,

These games do not crash on Edit Profile with a long name and are probably not exploitable:

- FIFA 06,
