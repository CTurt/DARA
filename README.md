Save game exploit for Fifa 08 to run unsigned code on DS.

CRCFix fixes the checksum of a save file to stop it showing up as corrupt in the game; run `make` on CRCFix directory to build it.

Run `make` on Sample directory to build Sample/save.sav, this is the exploitable save file.

To activate the exploit go to "My FIFA 08", and then "My Profile".
